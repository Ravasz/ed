Repository to backup code from Edinburgh proteomics projects.

This repo contains python and R scripts which are used to analyze proteomics data. 
They are not particuarly intended to be just downloaded and used as they do not come with appropriate documentation,
they have not been tested much and they were not designed with end users in mind. 
Still you are welcome to explore the individual scripts and use any bits you may need.
Should you need assistance, contact me on mate.ravasz@ed.ac.uk
